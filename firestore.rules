/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules for LocalBasket
 * @description This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles and store data,
 *              while allowing public read access to stores and their products. Orders are accessible only
 *              to the user who placed them. Product recommendations are private to each user. Cached recipes
 *              are publicly accessible to reduce AI usage, but restricted for writes.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: User profile data, accessible only by the user.
 * - /stores/{storeId}: Store data, accessible to the store owner for writes, public for reads.
 * - /stores/{storeId}/products/{productId}: Product data, accessible to the store owner for writes, public for reads.
 * - /stores/{storeId}/packages/{packageId}: Monthly package deals, accessible to the store owner for writes, public for reads.
 * - /orders/{orderId}: Order data, accessible only by the user who placed the order.
 * - /voice-orders/{voiceOrderId}: Voice-only order data, accessible to delivery partners for fulfillment.
 * - /orders/{orderId}/orderItems/{orderItemId}: Order item data, accessible only by the user who placed the order.
 * - /users/{userId}/productRecommendations/{productRecommendationId}: Product recommendations, private to each user.
 * - /cachedRecipes/{recipeId}: Cached recipe data, publicly readable and only writable by a service account.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only access their own profile data.
 * - Store owners can manage their stores and products.
 * - Orders are accessible only to the user who placed them.
 * - Product recommendations are private to each user.
 * - Cached recipes are publicly readable to reduce AI usage.
 * - Listing of users is disallowed.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Orders include 'userId' and 'storeId' to simplify authorization rules and avoid costly queries.
 * - OrderItems include 'orderId' to simplify authorization and avoid needing to query parent Order document.
 * - ProductRecommendations includes 'userId' to simplify authorization.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * - Private user data is stored under /users/{userId}, separate from public store/product data.
