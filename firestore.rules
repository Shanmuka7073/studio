/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for most data,
 *   with some collections being publicly readable but owner-writable.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - Users: /users/{userId} - Profile data, accessible only by the user themselves.
 * - Stores: /stores/{storeId} - Store data, accessible by anyone, but writable only by the store owner.
 * - Products: /stores/{storeId}/products/{productId} - Product data, accessible by anyone, but writable only by the store owner.
 * - Monthly Packages: /stores/{storeId}/packages/{packageId} - Package data, accessible by anyone, but writable only by the store owner.
 * - Orders: /orders/{orderId} - Order data, accessible by anyone, but writable only by the user who placed the order.
 * - Voice Orders: /voice-orders/{voiceOrderId} - Voice order data, accessible by anyone, but writable only by the user who placed the order.
 * - Order Items: /orders/{orderId}/orderItems/{orderItemId} - Order item data, accessible by anyone, but writable only by the user who placed the order.
 * - Product Recommendations: /users/{userId}/productRecommendations/{productRecommendationId} - Recommendation data, only accessible by the user.
 * - Cached Recipes: /cachedRecipes/{recipeId} - Cached recipe data, accessible by anyone, but only writable by an authorized admin.
 * - Delivery Partners: /deliveryPartners/{partnerId} - Delivery partner data, accessible only by the partner themselves.
 * - Payouts: /deliveryPartners/{partnerId}/payouts/{payoutId} - Payout data, accessible only by the partner themselves.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User data is strictly private and only accessible by the user themselves.
 * - Stores, Products, Monthly Packages, and Cached Recipes are publicly readable.
 * - Orders and Order Items are publicly readable.
 * - User listing is disallowed.
 * - The default security posture for ambiguous relationships is strict owner-only access.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The 'Order' and 'OrderItem' entities include denormalized 'userId' and 'storeId' fields to allow for efficient authorization checks without additional reads.
