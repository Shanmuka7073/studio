/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles and a mixed ownership model for stores and their associated data.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: User profile data, accessible only by the user themselves.
 * - /stores/{storeId}: Store data, writable only by the store owner.
 * - /stores/{storeId}/products/{productId}: Product data, writable only by the store owner.
 * - /stores/{storeId}/packages/{packageId}: Monthly package deals, writable only by the store owner.
 * - /orders/{orderId}: Order data, writable by any authenticated user, linked to the user via the userId field.
 * - /voice-orders/{voiceOrderId}: Voice order data, generally open for all to read but secured by owner-only writes.
 * - /orders/{orderId}/orderItems/{orderItemId}: Order items, accessible only if the parent order is accessible.
 * - /users/{userId}/productRecommendations/{productRecommendationId}: Product recommendations, accessible only to the user.
 * - /cachedRecipes/{recipeId}: Cached recipe data, publicly readable.
 * - /deliveryPartners/{partnerId}: Delivery partner data, accessible only by the partner themselves.
 * - /deliveryPartners/{partnerId}/payouts/{payoutId}: Payout requests, accessible only by the partner themselves.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only access their own profile data.
 * - Stores and their products can only be created, updated, or deleted by the store owner.
 * - Orders can be created by any authenticated user.
 * - Voice orders are publicly readable, but only the owner can modify or delete them.
 * - Product recommendations are user-specific and only accessible to the user.
 * - Cached recipes are publicly readable.
 * - Delivery partner data is only accessible by the partner themselves.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The 'Order' entity includes 'userId' to simplify order access rules.
 * - The 'OrderItem' entity includes 'orderId' to simplify order item access rules.
 * - The 'ProductRecommendation' entity includes 'userId' to simplify recommendation access rules.
