/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for LocalBasket application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user-specific data,
 * with public read access for some collections like stores and products.
 * It prioritizes security and data isolation, while allowing flexible data structures
 * for rapid prototyping.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile data, accessible only by the user.
 * - /stores/{storeId}: Stores data related to each store.
 * - /stores/{storeId}/products/{productId}: Stores product information under each store.
 * - /orders/{orderId}: Stores order information.
 * - /voice-orders/{voiceOrderId}: Stores voice-only orders, accessible by delivery partners.
 * - /orders/{orderId}/orderItems/{orderItemId}: Stores individual items within an order.
 * - /users/{userId}/productRecommendations/{productRecommendationId}: Stores product recommendations for each user.
 * - /cachedRecipes/{recipeId}: Stores cached recipe ingredients.
 * - /deliveryPartners/{partnerId}: Stores delivery partner earning and payout info.
 * - /deliveryPartners/{partnerId}/payouts/{payoutId}: Stores payout requests for a delivery partner.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only access their own profile data under /users/{userId}.
 * - Listing all users is disallowed for privacy reasons.
 * - Stores, Products, and CachedRecipes are publicly readable.
 * - Order listing is currently open to all users, but this may need to be restricted in the future.
 * - Delivery partners have access to voice orders for fulfillment.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Orders include `userId` and `storeId` to simplify authorization checks.
 * - OrderItems include `orderId` to simplify authorization checks.
 * - ProductRecommendations include `userId` to simplify authorization checks.
