/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for LocalBasket.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles and
 * store data. Stores and their associated products are owned by a specific user.
 * Orders are associated with users and stores. Access to user-specific data
 * (profile, product recommendations) is restricted to the authenticated user.
 * All write operations require user authentication.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: User profile information, accessible only by the user.
 * - /stores/{storeId}: Store information, owned by a user (ownerId).
 * - /stores/{storeId}/products/{productId}: Products listed by a store.
 * - /stores/{storeId}/packages/{packageId}: Monthly packages offered by the store.
 * - /orders/{orderId}: Order information, associated with a user and store.
 * - /voice-orders/{voiceOrderId}: Voice orders placed by users.
 * - /orders/{orderId}/orderItems/{orderItemId}: Items within an order.
 * - /users/{userId}/productRecommendations/{productRecommendationId}: Product recommendations for users.
 * - /cachedRecipes/{recipeId}: Cached recipe ingredients.
 * - /deliveryPartners/{partnerId}: Earnings and payout information for delivery partners.
 * - /deliveryPartners/{partnerId}/payouts/{payoutId}: Payout requests for delivery partners.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed.
 * - Public read access is generally disallowed, except where explicitly noted.
 * - Data consistency between the path and document fields (e.g., userId in /users/{userId}) is enforced on create and update.
 * - Monthly packages are secured under store ownership.
 * - Voice orders are accessible to anyone who can fulfill them, so no ownership restrictions.
 * - Cached recipes are open to anyone.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Orders include denormalized userId and storeId to simplify authorization rules and avoid costly queries.
 * - OrderItems include denormalized orderId for authorization independence.
 * - ProductRecommendations include denormalized userId for authorization independence.
