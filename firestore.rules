/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for LocalBasket.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a user-ownership model for user profiles and store data,
 * with public read access for some collections like stores and products. Orders
 * are secured based on user and store relationships. Delivery partner information
 * is secured to ensure only authorized users can access earnings and payout details.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: User profile information, accessible only by the user.
 * - /stores/{storeId}: Store information, accessible by anyone, but writable only by the store owner.
 * - /stores/{storeId}/products/{productId}: Product information for a store, publicly readable, writable by store owner.
 * - /orders/{orderId}: Order information, secured to the user who placed the order.
 * - /voice-orders/{voiceOrderId}: Voice order information, accessible for delivery partners.
 * - /orders/{orderId}/orderItems/{orderItemId}: Items within an order, secured via the parent order's rules.
 * - /users/{userId}/productRecommendations/{productRecommendationId}: Product recommendations specific to a user.
 * - /cachedRecipes/{recipeId}: Cached recipe data, publicly accessible.
 * - /deliveryPartners/{partnerId}: Earnings and payout info for delivery partners, secured to the partner.
 * - /deliveryPartners/{partnerId}/payouts/{payoutId}: Payout requests, secured to the partner.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only access their own profile data.
 * - Stores and products are publicly readable.
 * - Orders can only be created by authenticated users and listed by anyone(TODO: should be only accessible to the order owner).
 * - Delivery partner information is restricted to the delivery partner.
 * - No user listing is allowed.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Orders include 'userId' and 'storeId' to simplify authorization rules.
 * - OrderItems include 'orderId' for independent authorization.
 * - ProductRecommendations include 'userId' for independent authorization.
