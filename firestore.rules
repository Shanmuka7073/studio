/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for LocalBasket.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles and
 * store data, while also allowing public read access to certain collections
 * like stores and products. The delivery partner data is secured to only be accessed
 * by authenticated users who are the partners themselves.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: User profile data, accessible only by the user.
 * - /stores/{storeId}: Store data, readable by all, writable only by the store owner.
 * - /stores/{storeId}/products/{productId}: Product data for a specific store, readable by all, writable only by the store owner.
 * - /orders/{orderId}: Order data, accessible only by the user who created the order.
 * - /voice-orders/{voiceOrderId}: Voice order data, accessible by delivery partners.
 * - /orders/{orderId}/orderItems/{orderItemId}: Order items for a specific order, accessible only by the user who created the order.
 * - /users/{userId}/productRecommendations/{productRecommendationId}: Product recommendations for a user, accessible only by the user.
 * - /cachedRecipes/{recipeId}: Cached recipe data, publicly readable.
 * - /deliveryPartners/{partnerId}: Delivery partner data, accessible only by the partner themselves.
 * - /deliveryPartners/{partnerId}/payouts/{payoutId}: Payout data for a delivery partner, accessible only by the partner themselves.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed.
 * - Read-only collections like cachedRecipes are publicly readable.
 * - The default security posture for ambiguous relationships is strict owner-only access.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The Order and OrderItem entities denormalize userId and orderId respectively,
 *   to allow for simpler and more performant security rules without requiring
 *   expensive `get()` calls.
