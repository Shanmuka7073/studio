/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for LocalBasket application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a user-ownership model for user profiles and related data,
 * and allows stores to manage their own product listings. Orders are generally
 * accessible, but modifications are restricted.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profiles.
 * - /stores/{storeId}: Stores store information.
 * - /stores/{storeId}/products/{productId}: Stores product information for each store.
 * - /orders/{orderId}: Stores order information, with denormalized userId and storeId.
 * - /orders/{orderId}/orderItems/{orderItemId}: Stores order items for each order.
 * - /users/{userId}/productRecommendations/{productRecommendationId}: Stores personalized product recommendations.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only read and write their own profile data.
 * - Stores are publicly readable, but creation and modification are restricted to the owner.
 * - Products can only be managed by the store owner.
 * - Orders are listable by any authenticated user but are only creatable by the user that matches the `userId`.
 * - Listing of Orders is allowed for any authenticated user.
 * - Data shape is not strictly validated during this prototyping phase to allow flexible schema changes, but authorization is strictly enforced.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Orders include `userId` and `storeId` to simplify authorization checks.
 * - OrderItems include `orderId` for authorization independence.
 * - ProductRecommendations include `userId` for authorization independence.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * - User-specific data (profile, recommendations) is stored in user subcollections for privacy.
