/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for LocalBasket.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles and
 * store data, while also allowing public read access to store and product
 * information. Orders and associated order items are secured based on user ID
 * and order ID. Product recommendations are scoped to individual users. Voice orders are accessible for all users.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: User profile data, accessible only by the user.
 * - /stores/{storeId}: Store data, accessible by anyone, writable only by the store owner.
 * - /stores/{storeId}/products/{productId}: Product data, publicly readable, writable only by the store owner.
 * - /stores/{storeId}/packages/{packageId}: Monthly packages offered by a store, writable only by the store owner.
 * - /orders/{orderId}: Order data, writable only by the user who placed the order.
 * - /voice-orders/{voiceOrderId}: Voice order data.
 * - /orders/{orderId}/orderItems/{orderItemId}: Order item data, writable only by the user who placed the order.
 * - /users/{userId}/productRecommendations/{productRecommendationId}: Product recommendations, accessible only by the user.
 * - /cachedRecipes/{recipeId}: Cached recipe data for ingredients, accessible by anyone.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only access their own profile data.
 * - Stores and products are publicly readable but only writable by their owners.
 * - Orders and order items are secured to the user who placed the order.
 * - Voice orders are accessible for all users.
 * - Product recommendations are accessible only by the user they are for.
 * - Cached recipes are accessible by anyone.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Orders contain the userId.
 * - Stores contain the ownerId.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * - Private user data is stored under /users/{userId}.
 * - Public store and product data are stored under /stores/{storeId} and /stores/{storeId}/products/{productId}.
