/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules for LocalBasket
 *
 * @core_philosophy This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles and their associated data (recommendations).
 * Stores and their products are secured with owner-based access control. Orders are accessible by the user who created them.
 *
 * @data_structure
 * - /users/{userId}: User profile information; only accessible by the user themselves.
 * - /stores/{storeId}: Store data; accessible only by the store owner.
 * - /stores/{storeId}/products/{productId}: Product data for a specific store; accessible only by the store owner.
 * - /orders/{orderId}: Order data; accessible only by the user who created the order.
 * - /orders/{orderId}/orderItems/{orderItemId}: Order item data; accessible only by the user who created the order.
 * - /users/{userId}/productRecommendations/{productRecommendationId}: Product recommendations for a user; only accessible by the user themselves.
 *
 * @key_security_decisions
 * - Users can only access their own profile data.
 * - Stores can only be created, updated, and deleted by their owners.
 * - Products can only be created, updated, and deleted by the store owner.
 * - Orders can only be accessed by the user who created them.
 * - Users can only access their own product recommendations.
 * - Listing all users is disallowed.
