/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules for LocalBasket.
 *
 * @core_philosophy This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model where
 * users can only access their own data, stores are owned by specific users, and
 * orders are associated with users and stores. Public read access is granted
 * where appropriate, with ownership checks for write operations.
 *
 * @data_structure
 * - /users/{userId}: User profile data.
 * - /stores/{storeId}: Store data.
 * - /stores/{storeId}/products/{productId}: Product data for a specific store.
 * - /stores/{storeId}/packages/{packageId}: Monthly package deals for a specific store.
 * - /orders/{orderId}: Order data.
 * - /voice-orders/{voiceOrderId}: Voice order data
 * - /orders/{orderId}/orderItems/{orderItemId}: Order item data for a specific order.
 * - /users/{userId}/productRecommendations/{productRecommendationId}: Product recommendations for a specific user.
 * - /cachedRecipes/{recipeId}: Cached recipe ingredients for faster AI processing.
 * - /deliveryPartners/{partnerId}: Payout information for delivery partners. The document ID is the partner's user ID.
 * - /deliveryPartners/{partnerId}/payouts/{payoutId}: Payout requests made by delivery partners.
 *
 * @key_security_decisions
 * - Users can only read and write their own user data.
 * - Stores can be created, updated, and deleted only by the store owner.
 * - Products can be created, updated, and deleted only by the store owner.
 * - Orders are publicly readable, but writes are restricted.
 * - Delivery partner payouts are tightly restricted.
 * - Listing of order data is denied to all users.
 *
 * @denormalization_for_authorization
 * - Orders include denormalized 'userId' and 'storeId' for simpler authorization.
 * - OrderItems include a denormalized 'orderId' to allow independent authorization.
 * - ProductRecommendations include a denormalized 'userId' to allow independent authorization.
 *
 * @structural_segregation (Not applicable in this configuration)
