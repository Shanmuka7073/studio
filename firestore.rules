/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for LocalBasket application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset prioritizes secure, role-based access control. Users can only access their own data,
 * while delivery partners have limited access to order data for fulfillment. The rules are designed
 * to be easily maintainable and auditable.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile information. Only the user can access their own profile.
 * - /stores/{storeId}: Stores store information. Publicly readable.
 * - /stores/{storeId}/products/{productId}: Stores product information. Publicly readable.
 * - /stores/{storeId}/packages/{packageId}: Stores monthly package information. Publicly readable.
 * - /orders/{orderId}: Stores order information. Accessible by the user who created the order and the assigned delivery partner.
 * - /voice-orders/{voiceOrderId}: Stores voice order information. Publicly readable for store owners.
 * - /orders/{orderId}/orderItems/{orderItemId}: Stores individual order items. Accessible only with the parent order.
 * - /users/{userId}/productRecommendations/{productRecommendationId}: Stores personalized product recommendations. Only the user can access their own recommendations.
 * - /cachedRecipes/{recipeId}: Stores cached recipe data to reduce AI calls. Publicly readable.
 * - /deliveryPartners/{partnerId}: Stores payout information for delivery partners. Only accessible to the partner. Document ID is the same as the user ID.
 * - /deliveryPartners/{partnerId}/payouts/{payoutId}: Stores payout history for partners. Only accessible to the partner.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Strict user ownership for profile data (/users/{userId}).
 * - Public read access for store, product, and package information (/stores/{storeId}, /stores/{storeId}/products/{productId}, /stores/{storeId}/packages/{packageId}).
 * - Role-based access for orders, allowing both users and delivery partners limited access (/orders/{orderId}).
 * - Default deny for listing operations unless explicitly allowed.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The /orders/{orderId} document includes 'userId' and 'deliveryPartnerId' fields. This denormalization is crucial for efficient security rules,
 *   allowing us to avoid costly 'get()' operations to check user roles.
 * - The /orders/{orderId}/orderItems/{orderItemId} subcollection relies on the parent order's authorization. The 'orderId' is denormalized to enforce consistency.
 * - The /users/{userId}/productRecommendations/{productRecommendationId} subcollection includes 'userId' to enforce consistency.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * - Publicly accessible data (stores, products, packages, cached recipes) is stored in top-level collections, while private user data is stored under /users/{userId}.
