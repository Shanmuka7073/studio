/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles and store ownership,
 * with public read access for some collections and owner-only write access. It also manages store products
 * and monthly packages with store-owner-only access.
 *
 * @dataStructure
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profiles. Accessible only by the user themselves (owner-only).
 * - /stores/{storeId}: Stores store data.
 * - /stores/{storeId}/products/{productId}: Stores product data for each store. Accessible only by the store owner.
 * - /stores/{storeId}/packages/{packageId}: Stores monthly package deals for stores. Accessible only by the store owner.
 * - /orders/{orderId}: Stores order information.
 * - /voice-orders/{voiceOrderId}: Stores voice-only order data.
 * - /orders/{orderId}/orderItems/{orderItemId}: Stores individual items within an order.
 * - /users/{userId}/productRecommendations/{productRecommendationId}: Stores product recommendations for each user.
 * - /cachedRecipes/{recipeId}: Stores cached recipes to reduce AI calls; publicly readable.
 * - /deliveryPartners/{partnerId}: Stores information about delivery partners, accessible only by the partner themselves.
 * - /deliveryPartners/{partnerId}/payouts/{payoutId}: Stores payout information for delivery partners, accessible only by the partner themselves.
 *
 * @keySecurityDecisions
 * - User listing is disallowed.
 * - Strict ownership is enforced for user profiles and store data.
 * - Public read access is granted for the /cachedRecipes collection.
 * - Subcollections are secured based on the parent document's ownership or shared access.
 *
 * @denormalizationForAuthorization
 * - Orders include denormalized 'userId' and 'storeId' for simplified querying and security rules.
 * - OrderItems include denormalized 'orderId' for independent authorization.
