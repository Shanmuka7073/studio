/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules for LocalBasket
 * @description This ruleset enforces a user-ownership model for user profiles and store data.
 * Orders are accessible for reading by any authenticated user. Product recommendations
 * are restricted to the owning user. The rules are designed to be highly secure
 * from an authorization standpoint but flexible on data shapes to allow for rapid iteration.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile information. Only the user can read/write their own profile.
 * - /stores/{storeId}: Stores store information. Only the store owner can read/write store data.
 * - /stores/{storeId}/products/{productId}: Stores product information for a given store. Only the store owner can manage products.
 * - /stores/{storeId}/packages/{packageId}: Stores package information for a given store. Only the store owner can manage packages.
 * - /orders/{orderId}: Stores order information. Anyone can read orders.
 * - /voice-orders/{voiceOrderId}: Stores voice order data.
 * - /orders/{orderId}/orderItems/{orderItemId}: Stores individual order items.
 * - /users/{userId}/productRecommendations/{productRecommendationId}: Stores product recommendations for a user. Only the user can access their recommendations.
 * - /cachedRecipes/{recipeId}: Stores cached recipes, accessible to all for reading.
 * - /deliveryPartners/{partnerId}: Stores delivery partner information. Accessible only to the delivery partner.
 * - /deliveryPartners/{partnerId}/payouts/{payoutId}: Stores payout information for a delivery partner. Accessible only to the delivery partner.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only access their own data under /users/{userId}.
 * - Store owners have full control over their store data and associated products.
 * - Orders are readable by any authenticated user.
 * - Product recommendations are private to the user.
 * - Cached recipes are publicly readable.
 * - Delivery partner data and payouts are accessible only to the specific delivery partner.
 * - Listing of any collections is only allowed if explicitly permitted.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The `Order` entity denormalizes `userId` and `storeId` to allow for simpler querying and security rules.
 * - The `OrderItem` entity denormalizes `orderId` to allow authorization rules to be independent of the parent `Order` document.
 * - The `ProductRecommendation` entity denormalizes `userId` to allow authorization rules to be independent.
